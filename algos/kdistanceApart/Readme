Given a non-empty string s and an integer k, rearrange the string such that the same characters are at least distance k from each other.

All input strings are given in lowercase letters. If it is not possible to rearrange the string, return an empty string "".

Example 1:
s = "aabbcc", k = 3

Result: "abcabc"

The same letters are at least distance 3 from each other.
Example 2:
s = "aaabc", k = 3 

Answer: ""

It is not possible to rearrange the string.
Example 3:
s = "aaadbbcc", k = 2

Answer: "abacabcd"

Another possible answer is: "abcabcda"

The same letters are at least distance 2 from each other.

=========
Leetcode has a wrong answer to Example 1..  for aabbcc and k=3, abcabc is wrong as between between 2 a's there are only 2 characters.
