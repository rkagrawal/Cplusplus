Rotate a Linked List
Given a singly linked list, rotate the linked list counter-clockwise by k nodes. Where k is a given positive integer. For example, if the given linked list is 10->20->30->40->50->60 and k is 4, the list should be modified to 50->60->10->20->30->40. Assume that k is smaller than the count of nodes in linked list.

Recommended: Please solve it on “PRACTICE” first, before moving on to the solution.

To rotate the linked list, we need to change next of kth node to NULL, next of last node to previous head node, and finally change head to (k+1)th node. So we need to get hold of three nodes: kth node, (k+1)th node and last node.
Traverse the list from beginning and stop at kth node. Store pointer to kth node. We can get (k+1)th node using kthNode->next. Keep traversing till end and store pointer to last node also. Finally, change pointers as stated above.
