Problem statement: In a binary tree, a chain can be defined as sum of length of the left node series, right node series, and 1. Find the length of longest chain in the tree.

Example: Refer to the image given below â€“

Chain length of node 1 = 3 + 2 + 1 = {count of 3 corresponds to node 2 , node 4, node 8 ; count of 2 corresponds to node 3, node 7 ; 1 corresponds to node 1 itself}
Similarly, chain length of node 2 = 2 + 1 + 1
The max chain length here is of node 1 which is 5. So, the output should be 5.
